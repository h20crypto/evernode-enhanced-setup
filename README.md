## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository:
   - Name: `evernode-enhanced-setup`
   - Description: "One-command Evernode host enhancement suite"
   - Make it **Public** (required for raw file access)

2. **Upload all files** from the generated directory structure above

### Step 2: Update Scripts with Your GitHub Username

**In `quick-setup.sh`, replace this line:**
```bash
# Change this:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/evernode-enhanced-setup/main/landing-page/index.html

# To this (with your actual username):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youractualusername/evernode-enhanced-setup/main/landing-page/index.html
```

**Also update the install.sh download URL in quick-setup.sh:**
```bash
# Change this:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/evernode-enhanced-setup/main/install.sh | bash

# To this:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youractualusername/evernode-enhanced-setup/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

**Your final one-liner will be:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youractualusername/evernode-enhanced-setup/main/quick-setup.sh | sudo bash
```
